Software application written in C++ for the loading of *.tps files containing 7 landmark measurements and the creation of data ready for statistical processing. The application takes a directory of *.tps files, and can be used to calculate a series of measurements across cut or tooth mark cross-sections. The application can also be used to produce Morphologika files for further geometric morphometric processing
